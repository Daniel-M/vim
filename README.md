# vim  

This repository contains the personalized files for my vim plugins. This folder must be located at your home folder once the plugins are installed  
(BTW I'm using Debian Testing)

#### List of Plugins  
 * vim-addon-manager
 * vim-latexsuite   
 * vim-syntastic    
 * vim-youcompleteme

### Important Note
If you are a Debian user, you must enable the latex-suite addon by following the instructions given at  
 
 > /usr/share/doc/vim-latexsuite/README.Debian  

They suggest invoking vim-addon-manager to enable the plugin vim-latexsuite as

 > $ vim-addons install latex-suite  

In order to be able to use it
