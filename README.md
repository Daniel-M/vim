# vim  

This repository contains the personalized files for my vim plug-ins. This folder must be located at your home folder once the plug-ins are installed  
(BTW I'm using Debian Testing)

#### List of Plugins installed
The list of plug-ins installed are managed using *vim-addon-manager*    

 * vim-gocode (*Syntax support for golang*)  
 * vim-latexsuite (*Syntax support and utilies to edit latex text. Very recommended if you use latex*)   
 * vim-syntastic (*Syntax highlighting for a lot of languages *)    
 * vim-youcompleteme (*Vim autocompletion. So useful when coding*)   

Check the web to find more plugins suitable for you. Also, check the repositories for the plug-ins above to obtain more information and updates.   

### Important remarks

Add-ons can be easily installed invoking *vim-addon-manager*.     
For instance, installing the plugin *vim-latexsuite* can be done as,

 > $ vim-addons install latex-suite
